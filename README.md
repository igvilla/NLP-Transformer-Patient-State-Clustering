# NLP-Transformer-Patient-State-Clustering
For this project, the main goal was to use free-text responses obtained from chronic pain patients undergoing spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and determine their current patient state. This involved a pipeline starting with text pre-processing and followed with a pair of transformer models, prompt engineering a chat bot, and a clustering model.
